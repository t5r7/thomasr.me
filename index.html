            <span class="emoji-icon" aria-hidden="true">🏡</span>
            <span>Spending most of my time in Portsmouth at University, but returning home to Birmingham during holidays and breaks. Soon to start a 12-month internship in London; my wallet is more apprehensive than I am.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="emoji-icon" aria-hidden="true">⛰️</span>
            <span>Going outside and exploring! I keep a log of my <a href="https://thomasr.dev/visited-stations-map/">visited stations</a>, <a href="https://yom.railmiles.me/">rail journeys</a>, and <a href="https://openflights.org/user/yom">flight history</a>&mdash;because trains, data, statistics, and maps are cool.
            </span>

        <li>
            <span class="emoji-icon" aria-hidden="true">🥾</span>
            <span>Keeping active by hiking and rambling across the countryside. I enjoy working towards completing paths and trails, like the South Downs Way and the North Worcestershire Path. You can hold me accountable via <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/93454796">Strava</a>.</span>
