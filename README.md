# ThomasR.me

This is the source code for my site, nothing much of note.

Jekyll is the static site generator, mainly out of tradition at this point.

The site is deployed to a Hetzner VPS, proudly ARM-based and running NGINX. GitHub Actions builds the site and deploys it to the server. I used to use Vercel, but serverless is no fun ;)

Previous versions of the site—and many that have come before it—are available on-request. If you’re a curious friend of mine, you likely already have access to the graveyard.
