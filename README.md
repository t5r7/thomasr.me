# ThomasR.me

This is the source code for my site, nothing much of note. 

Jekyll is the static site generator, mainly out of tradition at this point.

The site is deployed to a Hetzner VPS, proudly ARM-based and running NGINX. GitHub Actions builds the site and deploys it to the server. I used to use Vercel, but serverless is no fun ;)

Except when [noted otherwise](ATTRIBUTION.txt), content in this repo is available under the [CC-BY-SA-4.0 license](LICENSE.txt). Please do let me know if you've done something interesting with any of this terrible code/content :)
