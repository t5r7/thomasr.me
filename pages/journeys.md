Trains! Statistics! Planes! Maps! Ferries! Graphs!

Find my 'everyday' train trips on [Railmiles](https://yom.railmiles.me/), or my Interrail jaunts mapped on [Viaduct](https://viaduct.world/share/m/keoojZtw4aiyV99I). My flights end up on [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/user/yom).

I also keep a log of [(nearly) every station](https://thomasr.dev/visited-stations/) I've visited. I'm not a [https://www.everylaststation.co.uk/] by any stretch, but it's interesting, if a pain, to keep track of.
