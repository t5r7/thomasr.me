I maintain a comprehensively documented 'homelab' which I use to play with enterprise-grade and industry-standard hardware & software. I use it to learn networking/administration fundamentals and experiment with new technologies/applications in an environment where it doesn't matter so much if things aren't perfect.

It hosts [many](https://imtom.notion.site/6c656fce02c64130bda09eb5c8f1fe4e) services and applications for friends, family and my own personal use, such as Plex, Guacamole, GitLab, Node-RED and more.

You can find more info about my setup within [my knowledgebase on Notion](https://wiki.tomr.me/lab); I am quite proud of how organised I have everything here.  
If you would like to learn more about being your own sysadmin, the [r/homelab subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/homelab) has some [excellent resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/wiki/introduction).
